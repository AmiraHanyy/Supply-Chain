The project involves an in-depth analysis of supply chain performance using Power BI dashboards. The visuals highlight key aspects such as inventory management, supplier performance, manufacturing costs, shipping efficiency, Customer Demographics , and revenue generation across different product types and locations.

# Key Insights :
# Inventory and Shipping Analysis:
Skincare products demonstrate the highest availability and stock levels, outperforming haircare and cosmetics.
Shipping costs show significant variation between carriers, with Carrier A emerging as the most cost-effective.
Cosmetics experience longer average shipping times, which negatively affects overall supply chain efficiency.
# Sales Performance:
Revenue generation is heavily driven by skincare products, accounting for over 70% of total revenue.
Despite a higher defect rate, skincare remains the most profitable product type.
Manufacturing costs and pricing are closely aligned with production volumes, particularly in skincare, indicating strong cost efficiency.
# Supplier Performance:
Lead times vary significantly among suppliers, with Supplier 4 having the longest, adversely affecting delivery schedules.
Certain routes, such as Route B, exhibit longer lead times, signaling potential logistical bottlenecks.
Geographical Revenue Distribution:
Kolkata emerges as the top revenue generator, especially in skincare, suggesting a high concentration of regional demand.
Bangalore and Delhi display balanced revenue contributions across all product types, indicating consistent market penetration.

# Transportation Modes:
Air: Fastest but most expensive.
